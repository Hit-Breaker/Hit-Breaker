            <h2 class="news-title">Alabama Shakes Announce First Tour Since 2017</h2>
            <p class="news-meta">By Pitchfork - February 7, 2025</p>
            <p class="news-content">Alabama Shakes—the trio of vocalist and guitarist Brittany Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, and bassist Zac Cockrell—played a surprise reunion set in December, and, now, they have announced that they’re going on tour for the first time since 2017. The band will tour North America in the summer, with support from Sam Evian, El Michels Affair, Shannon & the Clams, Lee Fields, and others. See all of Alabama Shakes’ tour dates below.

                In a press statement, Brittany Howard said: “Last year, Heath, Zac, and I started chatting about how much fun it would be to make music together and tour again as Alabama Shakes. This band and these songs have been such a source of joy for all of us. It is crazy that it has been 10 years since we released Sound & Color and eight years since we played a show. But, we didn’t want this to entirely be a look back. We wanted it to be as much about the future as the past. So we have a bunch of new music that will be released soon. We just can’t wait to experience that ‘feeling’ when we start playing those first few notes of ‘Don’t Wanna Fight’ or ‘Gimme All Your Love.’”
                
                As Howard mentioned, in her statement, Alabama Shakes shared their second studio album, Sound & Color, in April 2015. According to a press release, the band has been working on new material with producer Shawn Everett.</p>

            <h2 class="news-title">In Space, Barker Can Hear You Rave to “Reframing”</h2>
            <p class="news-meta">By Chal Ravens - February 7, 2025</p>
            <p class="news-content">Barker has achieved something rare with his weightless techno experiments: a sound that’s instantly identifiable as his own. His signature trick, perfected on four deliriously lovely records for Berghain’s label, Ostgut Ton, is to imagine dance music without the kick drums. And the effect, best enjoyed on headphones, is a full dunking into the bliss abyss. Barker has often talked about working with specific rules in the studio, and his new single “Reframing” sounds a lot like it was made this way. A nebula of sad synths and space-dust percussion floats high above a simple metronomic tick, its own rhythm slowly becoming unmoored from the beat, a bunch of balloons lost to the heavens. But like a ’60s phase-shifting experiment, the pattern inevitably finds itself back where it started, locked into the pulse again. It’s coming up, it’s coming up… like a big techno drop with a brainy twist, the payoff pairs the minimalist logic of Steve Reich with the emotional heights of trancelord Sasha. Barker’s forthcoming new album, Stochastic Drift, is supposedly an exercise in embracing the random. It’s a surprising thought—the ovoid orbits of “Reframing” don’t seem to have emerged by accident. But you could say the same for most objects in the known universe.</p>

            <h2 class="news-title">Kendrick Lamar’s Fierce and Petty 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show
            </h2>
            <p class="news-meta">By Clover Hope - February 10, 2025</p>
            <p class="news-content">The audience came for blood, but Kendrick Lamar made them wait. With his Super Bowl LIX halftime performance, Kendrick reminded everyone that, despite over 50 years of hip-hop history, rap still struggles for widespread recognition as a legitimate art form. And an important part of the genre is competition. His halftime show embraced that motif, framing America, football, the Super Bowl, and himself as components of a larger machine. The first face on screen? Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, the show’s narrator and scorekeeper, who declared, “This is the great American game.” Hip-hop is a quintessential All-American sport, too.
                Kendrick opened the performance atop a black Buick Grand National Experimental—the namesake of his 2024 album—wearing flare jeans, locked into a Gremlin stance, and spitting verses mainstream viewers probably couldn’t even Shazam before launching into GNX’s “Squabble Up.” He closed with a diss track that had the Caesars Superdome singing along to his pettiest lines, as Serena Williams delivered what had to be the Super Bowl’s first-ever on-field revenge-Crip Walk. The diss record symbolizes utter domination in hip-hop. And so goes America and football. But what do rap and football mean to Kendrick? Drama, sport, spectacle.
                
                Hip-hop has asserted its dominance on the Super Bowl stage since Jay-Z and Roc Nation began handling production with the 2020 show. Last night, Kendrick stood alone as the first solo rap headliner, less as a critical darling and more as a status symbol of hip-hop’s ascent. Just a week ago, he won five Grammys, including Song and Record of the Year for “Not Like Us,” cementing the Drake diss track as a cultural fixture—something we all already knew. But last night’s halftime show painted Drake as a dispensable henchman and America as the ultimate adversary. His high-octane GNX tracks made his set feel more contemporary and less like a legacy performance, à la Usher or Rihanna’s recent outings. The show was rich with subtext and loosely political—Kendrick’s reference to Gil Scott-Heron’s “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” at the start; Jackson’s taunt, “Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game?” For “Humble.,” Kendrick and his dancers formed an American flag with their bodies. Searching for meaning in Kendrick’s imagery can feel vexing when the meaning is more symbolic than overt. Maybe it’s about dominance at all costs. Maybe it’s all just a sick game where the most Kendrick could do was push the envelope as far as the NFL and the televised broadcast system would allow.</p>
